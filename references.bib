	abstract = {Park managers call for cost-effective and innovative solutions to handle a wide variety of environmental problems that threaten biodiversity in protected areas. Recently, drones have been called upon to revolutionize conservation and hold great potential to evolve and raise better-informed decisions to assist management. Despite great expectations, the benefits that drones could bring to foster effectiveness remain fundamentally unexplored. To address this gap, we performed a literature review about the use of drones in conservation. We selected a total of 256 studies, of which 99 were carried out in protected areas. We classified the studies in five distinct areas of applications: “wildlife monitoring and management”; “ecosystem monitoring”; “law enforcement”; “ecotourism”; and “environmental management and disaster response”. We also identified specific gaps and challenges that would allow for the expansion of critical research or monitoring. Our results support the evidence that drones hold merits to serve conservation actions and reinforce effective management, but multidisciplinary research must resolve the operational and analytical shortcomings that undermine the prospects for drones integration in protected areas.},

	abstract = {Recent technical advances in drones make them increasingly relevant and important tools for forest measurements. However, information on how to optimally set flight parameters and choose sensor resolution is lagging behind the technical developments. Our study aims to address this gap, exploring the effects of drone flight parameters (altitude, image overlap, and sensor resolution) on image reconstruction and successful 3D point extraction. This study was conducted using video footage obtained from flights at several altitudes, sampled for images at varying frequencies to obtain forward overlap ratios ranging between 91 and 99\%. Artificial reduction of image resolution was used to simulate sensor resolutions between 0.3 and 8.3 Megapixels (Mpx). The resulting data matrix was analysed using commercial multi-view reconstruction (MVG) software to understand the effects of drone variables on (1) reconstruction detail and precision, (2) flight times of the drone, and (3) reconstruction times during data processing. The correlations between variables were statistically analysed with a multivariate generalised additive model (GAM), based on a tensor spline smoother to construct response surfaces. Flight time was linearly related to altitude, while processing time was mainly influenced by altitude and forward overlap, which in turn changed the number of images processed. Low flight altitudes yielded the highest reconstruction details and best precision, particularly in combination with high image overlaps. Interestingly, this effect was nonlinear and not directly related to increased sensor resolution at higher altitudes. We suggest that image geometry and high image frequency enable the MVG algorithm to identify more points on the silhouettes of tree crowns. Our results are some of the first estimates of reasonable value ranges for flight parameter selection for forestry applications.},

	abstract = {Ecological remote sensing is being transformed by three-dimensional (3D), multispectral measurements of forest canopies by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and computer vision structure from motion (SFM) algorithms. Yet applications of this technology have out-paced understanding of the relationship between collection method and data quality. Here, UAV-SFM remote sensing was used to produce 3D multispectral point clouds of Temperate Deciduous forests at different levels of UAV altitude, image overlap, weather, and image processing. Error in canopy height estimates was explained by the alignment of the canopy height model to the digital terrain model (R2 = 0.81) due to differences in lighting and image overlap. Accounting for this, no significant differences were observed in height error at different levels of lighting, altitude, and side overlap. Overall, accurate estimates of canopy height compared to field measurements (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.6 m) and LIDAR (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 3.0 m) were obtained under optimal conditions of clear lighting and high image overlap ({\textgreater}80\%). Variation in point cloud quality appeared related to the behavior of SFM ‘image features’. Future research should consider the role of image features as the fundamental unit of SFM remote sensing, akin to the pixel of optical imaging and the laser pulse of LIDAR.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents the design, fabrication, and performance of the charged couple device (CCD) images. Decrease in transfer inefficiency over the surface-channel CCD technology is generally accepted to be at least an order of magnitude. Because of the fact that these commercially available devices are primarily line-scan image sensors and two-dimensional arrays with intrinsic silicon spectral response, it is intentional that there will be a heavy emphasis on these types of devices. The modulation-transfer function describes the fidelity of an imaging system by giving the attenuation of an image signal as a function of spatial frequency. In CCD image sensors, the MTF is the result of several parameters: the photo element aperture, the optical cross talk, the charge-transfer inefficiency, and the preamplifier characteristics. An n-channel CCD line-scan image sensor can be fabricated much like a high-density NMOS memory device. They both use two levels of polysilicon gates. Ion implantation is essential as a means of doping and is used at least twice in the course of making a typical two-phase device: once to form the n-channel and again to form the barriers that are located under the gaps in the first level of poly-Si along the CCD registers. A CCD signal-processing device that could appropriately be used in a camera for image processing is considered for application in spacecraft navigation and camera pointing. A significant feature of this technology is the high uniformity of response that is possible in the case of illumination from the silicon side.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Exploring the comprehensive impact of landscape pattern changes on regional ecosystem service values (ESVs) over a long time series is significant for optimizing ecosystem management. This study took Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (HTRNP) as a case and first assessed its five vital ecosystem services (ESs): water supply (WS), water purification (WP), carbon storage (CS), soil retention (SR), and habitat quality (HQ). Based on the ESs assessment results, we further calculated their ESVs and quantified the responses of ESVs to landscape pattern changes during 1980–2020. The results revealed that: (1) Forestland is the basal landscape type of HTRNP. Landscape patterns changed significantly after 2000; the proportion of both cultivated land and grassland decreased, while the proportion of forestland, water, and construction land increased; with the areas and landscape dominance of both forestland and water increased, the agglomeration and connectivity of the overall landscape increased and its homogenization decreased. (2) WS, WP, CS, and SR services tended to weaken, and HQ service tended to strengthen. The spatial heterogeneities of WS and SR changed significantly over time. WS, HQ, SR, and CS are the main contributors to the total ESV. During 1980–2020, the four ESVs of WS, WP, SR, and CS showed a decreasing trend; HQ’s ESV tended to increase, and the total ESV tended to decrease. (3) The increase of areas and dominance in forestland and water was the main reason that HQ’s ESV tended to increase, and WP’s ESV and CS’s ESV tended to decrease. The construction land scale was relatively small, so its impacts on ESVs were limited. The responses of both WS’s ESV and SR’s ESV to landscape pattern changes were insignificant due to the impacts of topographic and climatic factors. The study results provide a reference for managing and optimizing HTRNP’s ecosystem to improve its integrated benefits of crucial ESs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Oil crops are among the main drivers of global land use changes. Palm oil is possibly the most criticized, as a driver of primary tropical forests loss. This has generated two different reactions in its use in various sectors (e.g., food, feed, biodiesel, surfactant applications, etc.): from one side there is a growing claim for deforestation-free palm oil, whereas on the other side the attention raised towards other vegetable oils as possible substitutes, such as soybean, rapeseed and sunflower oil. We assess potential land use changes and consequent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for switching from palm oil to other oils and compare this solution to deforestation-free palm oils. We consider three scenarios of 25 \%, 50 \% and 100 \% palm oil replacement in the eight major oil crop producing countries. Total GHG emissions account for anthropogenic emissions generated along the life cycle of the field production process and potential forest carbon stock losses from land use change for oil crops expansion. Replacing palm oil with other oils would have a worthless effect in terms of global emissions reduction since GHG emissions remain approximatively stable across the three scenarios, whereas it would produce a deforestation increase of 28.2 to 51.9 Mha worldwide (or 7 to 21.5 Mha if excluding the unlikely deforestation in USA, Russia, Ukraine and the offset deforestation in China, India). Conversely, if the global palm oil production becomes deforestation-free, its GHG emissions would be reduced by 92 \%, switching from the current 371 to 29 Mt CO2eq per year. Although highlighting the historical unsustainability of oil palm plantations, results show that replacing them with other oil crops almost never represents a more sustainable solution, thus potentially questioning sustainability claims of palm oil free products with respect to deforestation-free palm oil.},

All components of environment i.e. air, water and soil are altering mainly due to anthropogenic activities especially with changing life styles. The objective of this mini review is to elaborate the different climate changes, their causes and effects. Generally, climate change refers to any disturbance in climate which can cause negative impacts on living organisms which include humans, plants, and animals, which will be adverse for environment. With increase in population on the earth and industrialization the environment of the world is being disturbed every day. Human is destroying natural resources continuously for his own pleasure and convenience. Due to Carbon dioxide and other dangerous gases expelling from automobiles and industries are continuously poisoning air. Factories are releasing their wastes directly in water bodies without proper treatment and making them unfit for aquatic life. Plants act as filters which trap all pollutants to make environment cool, clean and green. Increase in population multiplication without increasing the plantation would completely damage the quality of life and our society in future. Plants are natural purifier of environment. Due to increasing concentration of carbon dioxide and global warming, temperature of earth is increasing day by day which cause various disorders in environment. The purpose of this review is to highlight climate change which is mostly occurring when there is rise in temperature and CO2 concentration and its impacts on environment. This change in climate is not beneficial rather it causes the damage of an ecosystem. So, human activities are changing the environment adversely. Increasing climate changes have affected life in different aspects. It is concluded that if we don’t plan the strategies to overcome these changes, in coming few years life on the earth will not be an easy task, and situation will be out of hand.},

Matching measurers are defined, expressing similarity between color pattern-cards, robust to a substantial amount of object occlusion and cluttering. Based on the color pattern-cards and matching measures, a hashing scheme is presented offering constant run-time image retrieval independent of the number of images in the image database. To evaluate accuracy of the image retrieval scheme, experiments have been conducted on a database consisting of 500 images taken from multicolored man-made objects in real world scenes. The results show that high image retrieval accuracy is achieved. Also, robustness is demonstrated against a change in viewing position, partial occlusion, and a substantial amount of object cluttering.

shadow, illumination, highlights, and noise. Extensive experiments show the different invariants to be highly discriminative, while
maintaining invariance properties. The presented framework for color measurement is well-founded in the physics of color as well as in

We also discuss the differences for each method. The results indicate Brightness method and Nagao’s method are significantly better than NIR method. NIR often confuses water bodies with shadows due to the low reflectance of water. The data space we used, Nagao’s modified intensity and brightness are better than NIR channel to discriminate shadows from non-shadows, and the two methods are both not easily confused with shadow and water bodies. In our study, we found that most of cases presented shadow in the histogram of first mode, and the first valley detection thresholding is a robust way to detect the shadow threshold of histogram.

Providing accurate oil palm plantation statistics is essential to supporting effective and efficient decision-making, especially since the oil palm industry has a strategic role in achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The existing conventional data collection has been focusing on field survey methods which require considerable human resources and costs, long collection and processing times, and have difficulty in reaching remote areas. Remote sensing with satellite imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can be an alternative due to its advantages which include a more efficient workforce, shorter update times, comprehensive area coverage, and the ability to reach remote locations. In this study, we propose the utilization of Microsoft Bing Maps Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and UAV with image processing threshold and object-based deep learning methods to detect and count the number of oil palm trees. Experimental results in a case study in Rokan Hulu Regency, Riau, Indonesia show that the object-based deep learning model of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture achieves excellent performance with an F1-Score of up to 91.05\%. This model is superior to the widely adopted baseline model of the image processing threshold, which only reached an F1-Score of 40.59\%. Our findings suggest the use of very high resolution images with object-based deep learning is promising for automatic detection and counting of oil palm trees to support the accurate and sustainable agricultural monitoring.},

	abstract = {Calibration and validation of aboveground biomass (AGB) (AGB) products retrieved from satellite-borne sensors require accurate AGB estimates across hectare scales (1 to 100ha). Recent studies recommend making use of non-destructive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) based techniques for individual tree AGB estimation that provide unbiased AGB predictors. However, applying these techniques across large sites and landscapes remains logistically challenging. Unoccupied aerial vehicle laser scanning (UAV-LS) has the potential to address this through the collection of high density point clouds across many hectares, but estimation of individual tree AGB based on these data has been challenging so far, especially in dense tropical canopies. In this study, we investigated how TLS and UAV-LS can be used for this purpose by testing different modelling strategies with data availability and modelling framework requirements. The study included data from four forested sites across three biomes: temperate, wet tropical, and tropical savanna. At each site, coincident TLS and UAV-LS campaigns were conducted. Diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height were estimated from TLS point clouds. Individual tree AGB was estimated for ≥170 trees per site based on TLS tree point clouds and quantitative structure modelling (QSM), and treated as the best available, non-destructive estimate of AGB in the absence of direct, destructive measurements. Individual trees were automatically segmented from the UAV-LS point clouds using a shortest-path algorithm on the full 3D point cloud. Predictions were evaluated in terms of individual tree root mean square error (RMSE) and population bias, the latter being the absolute difference between total tree sample population TLS QSM estimated AGB and predicted AGB. The application of global allometric scaling models (ASM) at local scale and across data modalities, i.e., field-inventory and light detection and ranging LiDAR metrics, resulted in individual tree prediction errors in the range of reported studies, but relatively high population bias. The use of adjustment factors should be considered to translate between data modalities. When calibrating local models, DBH was confirmed as a strong predictor of AGB, and useful when scaling AGB estimates with field inventories. The combination of UAV-LS derived tree metrics with non-parametric modelling generally produced high individual tree RMSE, but very low population bias of ≤5\% across sites starting from 55 training samples. UAV-LS has the potential to scale AGB estimates across hectares with reduced fieldwork time. Overall, this study contributes to the exploitation of TLS and UAV-LS for hectare scale, non-destructive AGB estimation relevant for the calibration and validation of space-borne missions targeting AGB estimation.},

	abstract = {Accurately quantifying tree and forest structure is important for monitoring and understanding terrestrial ecosystem functioning in a changing climate. The emergence of laser scanning, such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS), has advanced accurate and detailed forest structural measurements. TLS generally provides very accurate measurements on the plot-scale (a few ha), whereas UAV-LS provides comparable measurements on the landscape-scale ({\textgreater}10 ha). Despite the pivotal role dense tropical forests play in our climate, the strengths and limitations of TLS and UAV-LS to accurately measure structural metrics in these forests remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose to combine TLS and UAV-LS data from dense tropical forest plots to analyse how this fusion can further advance 3D structural mapping of structurally complex forests. We compared stand (vertical point distribution profiles) and tree level metrics from TLS, UAV-LS as well as their fused point cloud. The tree level metrics included the diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), crown projection area (CPA), and crown volume (CV). Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of point density and number of returns for UAV-LS data acquisition. DBH measurements from TLS and UAV-LS were compared to census data. The TLS and UAV-LS based H, CPA and CV measurements were compared to those obtained from the fused point cloud. Our results for two tropical rainforest plots in Australia demonstrate that TLS can measure H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of 0.30 m (Haverage =27.32 m), 3.06 m2 (CPAaverage =66.74 m2), and 29.63 m3 (CVaverage =318.81 m3) respectively. UAV-LS measures H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of {\textless}0.40 m, {\textless}5.50 m2, and {\textless}30.33 m3 respectively. However, in dense tropical forests single flight UAV-LS is unable to sample the tree stems sufficiently for DBH measurement due to a limited penetration of the canopy. TLS can determine DBH with an accuracy (RMSE) of 5.04 cm, (DBHaverage =45.08 cm), whereas UAV-LS can not. We show that in dense tropical forests stand-alone TLS is able to measure macroscopic structural tree metrics on plot-scale. We also show that UAV-LS can be used to quickly measure H, CPA, and CV of canopy trees on the landscape-scale with comparable accuracy to TLS. Hence, the fusion of TLS and UAV-LS, which can be time consuming and expensive, is not required for these purposes. However, TLS and UAV-LS fusion opens up new avenues to improve stand-alone UAV-LS structural measurements at the landscape-scale by applying TLS as a local calibration tool.},

	abstract = {With Apis mellifera (the European Honey Bee) having an average forage radius of less than one kilometre from their hive, selecting the best location for beehives is critical for commercial beekeepers to optimise their honey production. In this study, we have used standard three-band digital cameras to develop and assess a simple parallelpiped algorithm to detect the flowers of the Corymbia calophylla tree in Western Australia, the largest source of honey in the state. The algorithm has been tested in a number of situations and, within the bounds of the study, works to a better than 90\% classification accuracy for Digital Single Lens Reflex camera images of trees within 15 m distance, and often better than 95\%. To determine how this approach could be used by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle platforms to detect flowering Corymbia calophylla flowering, image resolution was progressively degraded until flowers could not be detected. It was found that the cluster size of flowers (i.e. whether flowers occur individually or in groups) played an important role in determining the accuracy of flower detection, but overall a minimum resolution of 10 pixels per flower is required for reliable detection of flower pixels. While there is some improvement above this resolution, the effect is minimal. The key to accurate measurement of percentage flower cover is the accuracy of the classification of the background. If the background classification error is known for an image or scene, the percentage flower cover can be calculated with as little as 2\% flower cover. Based on this study, UAV platforms with standard RGB cameras appear to be suitable for detection of Corymbia calophylla flowers if surveys are designed within the bounds described. Thus, UAV surveys may prove to be useful for beekeepers to optimise the location of their beehives amongst a choice of different locations.},

	abstract = {Accurate classification of individual tree species is essential for inventorying, managing, and protecting forest resources. Individual tree species classification in subtropical forests remains challenging as existing individual tree segmentation algorithms typically result in over-segmentation in subtropical broadleaf forests, in which tree crowns often have multiple peaks. In this study, we proposed a watershed-spectral-texture-controlled normalized cut (WST-Ncut) algorithm, and applied it to delineate individual trees in a subtropical broadleaf forest situated in Shenzhen City of southern China (114°23′28″E, 22°43′50″N). Using this algorithm, we first obtained accurate crown boundary of individual broadleaf trees. We then extracted different suites of vertical structural, spectral, and textural features from UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data, and used these features as inputs to a random forest classifier to classify 18 tree species. The results showed that the proposed WST-Ncut algorithm could reduce the over-segmentation of the watershed segmentation algorithm, and thereby was effective for delineating individual trees in subtropical broadleaf forests (Recall = 0.95, Precision = 0.86, and F-score = 0.91). Combining the structural, spectral, and textural features of individual trees provided the best tree species classification results, with overall accuracy reaching 91.8\%, which was 10.2\%, 13.6\%, and 19.0\% higher than that of using spectral, structural, and textural features alone, respectively. In addition, results showed that better individual tree segmentation would lead to higher accuracy of tree species classification, but the increase of the number of tree species would result in the decline of classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {Based on very high resolution satellite images, object-based classification methods can be used to produce large scale maps for forest management. These new products require a method to derive quantitative information about the accuracy and precision of delineated boundaries. This assessment would complement any measure of thematic accuracy derived from the confusion matrix. This study aims to assess the positional quality of the boundaries between different landscape units produced by automated segmentation of IKONOS and SPOT-5 satellite images over temperate forests. A robust method was developed to assess the accuracy and the precision of the forest boundaries, respectively measured by the bias and the standard deviation. The two main sources of positional error, namely residual parallax and automatic segmentation, were independently assessed. Positional errors caused by the residual parallax were quantified using a 3D model. Forest stand boundaries generated by automatic segmentation were compared to corresponding visual delineations. The results showed that residual parallax was the major source of positive bias (area overestimation) along forest/non-forest boundaries and depended on the interactions between forest stand patterns and sensor viewing angles. Due mainly to tree shade, the automatic segmentation also produced a positive bias on forest areas, which remained under 1 m for both IKONOS-2 and SPOT-5 images. Standard deviation did not increase linearly with pixel size and was influenced by the nature of the boundary. Production of 1:20,000 scale forest maps from very high resolution satellite data clearly requires acquisition of near nadir imagery or knowledge of landscape object height for true orthorectification. In these cases, IKONOS-2 segmentation outputs were found to correspond with 1:20,000 scale map specification, and SPOT-5 imagery with 1:30,000 scale.},

Modern photogrammetry and remote sensing identiﬁed the potential of UAS-sourced imagery more than thirty years ago. In the last ﬁve years, these two sister disciplines have developed technology and methods that challenge the current aeronautical regulatory framework and their own traditional acquisition and processing methods. Navety and ingenuity have combined off-the-shelf, low-cost equipment with sophisticated computer vision, robotics and geomatic engineering. The results are cm-level resolution and accuracy products that can be generated even with cameras costing a few-hundred euros.

Quantifying this erosion is challenging because ground data on tropical biodiversity and biomass are often sparse. Here, we use an unprecedented dataset of 1819 field surveys covering the entire Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We show that 83−85\% of the surveys presented losses in forest biomass and tree species richness, functional traits, and conservation value. On average, forest fragments have 25−32\% less biomass, 23−31\% fewer species, and 33, 36, and 42\% fewer individuals of late-successional, large-seeded, and endemic species, respectively. Biodiversity and biomass erosion are lower inside strictly protected conservation units, particularly in large ones. We estimate that biomass erosion across the Atlantic Forest remnants is equivalent to the loss of 55−70 thousand km2 of forests or US\$2.3−2.6 billion in carbon credits. These figures have direct implications on mechanisms of climate change mitigation.},

However, the costs to maintain a long-term monitoring site are enormous. Lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) have been rapidly emerging as a new tool for local-scale monitoring. To evaluate the value of drone applications in long-term ecological studies, we combined drone-derived canopy variables, detailed ground-based stem-mapping data and topographic and edaphic variables from a 20-ha forest dynamics plot in a species-rich subtropical forest. Speciﬁcally, we evaluated the relative importance of these variables in explaining local-scale variation in forest stand and species measures. We found that drone-derived canopy variables contributed substantially towards explaining local patterns of biodiversity and more speciﬁcally in supporting a gap dynamics hypothesis in structuring observed forest biodiversity. Stand basal area was positively related with canopy closure, indicating the importance of protecting old-growth forests as carbon sinks. The importance of topographic and edaphic variables was also demonstrated, supporting a niche differentiation hypothesis in structuring patterns in biodiversity. Species-level analyses illustrated that light-demanding species were more strongly correlated with canopy variables than shade-tolerant species. We provide convincing evidence that drones can add substantial value to long-term ecological monitoring by providing low cost, high resolution data. Drones should be included in the ecologist's toolbox to complement traditional ﬁeld surveys.},

In this context, the Brazilian government committed itself to restore 12 million hectares of forests by 2030. RDA monitoring customarily depends on extensive fieldwork to collect data on all individuals planted. As remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) can reduce costs and time of fieldwork activities, studying this technology is therefore timely given. A crucial metric for RDA is the number of trees established in the area. Methods using RPAs on automatic tree counting showed good accuracy using algorithms based on the canopy height model (CHM), which is the difference between a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM). However, obtaining a DTM demands an extra computational processing step and may require field control points or manually delimiting objects on the surface. The study presented here proposes and evaluates a semi-automated methodology for counting trees directly on DSM in RDAs in the Amazon using RPA coupled with a red–green–blue standard photographic sensor. The DSM method obtained good overall accuracy and F-score indexes, superior to the CHM method for all study areas even when overall accuracy was low for both methods.},

Since remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) generate a panoramic high resolution and georeferenced view of the entire area of interest, this technology has high potential to improve the traditional FR monitoring methods. This study evaluates how low-cost RPA data may contribute to FR monitoring of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by the automatic remote measurement of Tree Density, Tree Height, Vegetation Cover (area covered by trees), and Grass Infestation. The point cloud data was processed to map the Tree Density, Tree Height, and Vegetation Cover parameters. The orthomosaic was used for a Random Forest classification that considered trees and grasses as a single land cover class. The Grass Infestation parameter was mapped by the difference between this land cover class (which considered trees and grasses) and the Vegetation Cover results (obtained by the point cloud data processing). Tree Density, Vegetation Cover, and Grass Infestation parameters presented F\_scores of 0.92, 0.85, and 0.64, respectively. Tree Height accuracy was indicated by the Error Percentage considering the traditional fieldwork and the RPA results. The Error Percentage was equal to 0.13 and was considered accurate because it estimated a 13\% shorter height for trees that averaged 1.93 m tall. Thus, this study showed that the FR structural parameters were accurately measured by the low-cost RPA, a technology that contributes to FR monitoring. Despite accurately measuring the structural parameters, this study reinforced the challenge of measuring the Biodiversity parameter via remote sensing because the classification of tree species was not possible. After all, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hotspot, and thus different species have similar spectral responses in the visible spectrum and similar geometric forms. Therefore, until improved automatic classification methods become available for tree species, traditional fieldwork remains necessary for a complete FR monitoring diagnostic.},

However, the related existing knowledge is spread over hundreds of documents, many of them unpublished and/or difficult to access. Synthesis initiatives are available, but they are restricted to only a few parts or types of the AF or are focused on species occurrence. Here, we conducted an extensive review to compile quantitative tree community surveys on all types of the AF until 2013 and to study where and how these surveys were conducted. We found 1157 relevant references, containing 2441 forest surveys published since 1945. These surveys corresponded to 2.24 million trees and 1817 ha of forests sampled. This total sampled area represents only 0.01 \% of the AF remnants, showing how limited our knowledge is on AF structure. For Paraguay and the Brazilian states of Bahia and Mato Grosso do Sul this proportion was much smaller. The same was true for evergreen rainforests, Brejos de altitude and deciduous forests and most probably for the rare cloud, swamp, Caxetal and Mussununga forests for which no accurate remnant estimates were found. Since the 1980s, the amount of AF area sampled each year has increased continuously, but approximately 100 years will be necessary to sample at least 1 \% of the AF. Thus, we urgently need an enormous amount of high-quality quantitative data to overcome our limited knowledge of the AF and to support conservation programs aiming to safeguard this threatened biodiversity hotspot.},

            A shadow appears on an area when the light from a source cannot reach the area due to obstruction by an object. The shadows are sometimes helpful for providing useful information about objects. However, they cause problems in computer vision applications, such as segmentation, object detection and object counting. Thus shadow detection and removal is a pre-processing task in many computer vision applications. This paper proposes a simple method to detect and remove shadows from a single RGB image. A shadow detection method is selected on the basis of the mean value of RGB image in A and B planes of LAB equivalent of the image. The shadow removal is done by multiplying the shadow region by a constant. Shadow edge correction is done to reduce the errors due to diffusion in the shadow boundary.},

In contrast with the platforms of manned aircraft and satellite, the UAV platform holds many promising characteristics: flexibility, efficiency, high-spatial/temporal resolution, low cost, easy operation, etc., which make it an effective complement to other remote-sensing platforms and a cost-effective means for remote sensing. Considering the popularity and expansion of UAV-based remote sensing in recent years, this paper provides a systematic survey on the recent advances and future prospectives of UAVs in the remote-sensing community. Specifically, the main challenges and key technologies of remote-sensing data processing based on UAVs are discussed and summarized firstly. Then, we provide an overview of the widespread applications of UAVs in remote sensing. Finally, some prospects for future work are discussed. We hope this paper will provide remote-sensing researchers an overall picture of recent UAV-based remote sensing developments and help guide the further research on this topic.},

Threshold detection is performed on normalized blue band, and original blue band based on shadow regions has higher pixel value than non-shadowed regions in blue band. Combined the two threshold detection results, an original shadow mask is obtained. Then small region removal and morphological algorithm are used to get accurate shadow mask. Each shadow region is matched to its adjacent non-shadowed region on RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space and HIS (Hue, Intensity, Saturation) color space respectively to finish shadow removal. At last, median filtering is performed along the edge of each shadow mask in order to reduce the effect of noise. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm performs well and a better compensation result is obtained in HSI color space.},

In this paper, we focus on one of the most popular of such indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and we introduce a statistical framework to analyze it. As the degree of vegetation increases, the corresponding NDVI values begin to saturate and cannot represent highly vegetated regions reliably. By adopting the statistical viewpoint, we show how to obtain a linearized and more reliable measure. While the NDVI uses only red and near-infrared bands, we use the statistical framework to introduce new indices using the blue and green bands as well. We compare these indices with that obtained by linearizing the NDVI with extensive experimental results on real IKONOS multispectral images.},

Preventing illegal deforestation activities is an emergent and crucial mission for the world. Recently, automated monitoring systems using Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) appear as a promising solution to combat deforestation. However, the quality design of such systems considering the deforestation prevention impacts remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose a socio-ICT (Information Communication Technology) model that enables to analyze the deforestation prevention impacts of a UAV-based monitoring system quantitatively. The socio-ICT model uses a causal loop diagram to formulate the relations among system quality measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with deforestation prevention. Through the numerical study, we estimate the effectiveness of the UAV monitoring system by annual deforestation rate and CO2 gas emissions. Our analysis shows important design trade-offs need to be considered when planning UAV-based monitoring systems.},

The cost of acquiring DAI is very expensive and suitable for large area coverage. The acquisition of DAI is not economical and suitable for small area coverage. Therefore an alternative method should be used to fulfill this need. There are two alternative methods that can be used for acquisition of DAI which include using a small format digital camera attached to light aircraft and using a small format attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). UAV system has been reported used in various and diversified applications such as mapping applications (eg. map revision, landslide, coastal erosion, archaeology, forestry), industrial application (eg. engineering, crash accident), Geographic Information System (GIS) applications and others. In this study, micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems which comprise of fixed wing UAV flying and rotary UAV are attached with small format high resolution digital camera to acquire DAI for the purpose of mapping at the flying height of 300m at 100m respectively. The micro UAVs were flown autonomously (i.e automatically) and a series of DAIs of a slope using fixed wing UAV and a stream using rotary UAV were acquired rapidly within short period. Ground control point (GCP) and check point (CP) were established using the Global Positioning System and conventional Total Station techniques around the study area for the slope and stream respectively for the purpose of digital image processing and accuracy assessment. The DAIs were processed to produce photogrammetric output such as digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto. All these photogrammetric products were successfully produced and assessed. The achievable accuracy is less than ±1m for slope mapping and ±0.280m for stream mapping. In this study, it is proven that the micro UAV system can be used for mapping which cover small area. As conclusion, micro UAV is suitable for mapping small area, rapid data acquisition, accurate, low cost and can be employed for various applications.},

Environmentalism has never been about catastrophe. It is about alternatives, about changing course, about transforming the future." --Philip Shabecoff, from Earth Rising Philip Shabecoff, America's preeminent environmental journalist, has spent more than two decades thinking and writing about the environment and related subjects, as a reporter for The New York Times, as publisher of Greenwire, and as the author of two books, including the critically acclaimed A Fierce Green Fire. In Earth Rising, he draws on that experience to offer a pointed and thought-provoking critique of the current state and future prospects of the American environmental movement.Based on extensive interviews with a wide range of individuals both within and outside of the movement, Shabecoff elucidates the issues and problems confronting today's environmentalists and analyzes the movement's strengths and weaknesses. Viewing environmental threats as symptoms of flaws in our society and its systems, he considers the urgent need for a broader, more inclusive environmentalism, and examines the role environmentalists can -- and must -- play in: reforming the education system taming the global economy and making it an instrument of human needs working for political reform, including reducing the influence of corporate spending on the electoral process directing the course of the scientific enterprise as well as making use of its results helping develop a new moral center for people throughout the nation and the world Throughout, Shabecoff emphasizes the need for national organizations to link together with grassroots groups and to become more responsive to local concerns, and argues that the environmental movement has not yet adequately prepared itself to meet current and coming challenges. He makes a compelling case that another wave of environmentalism is needed -- more powerful, diverse and sophisticated, visionary and flexible. Earth Rising offers a detailed road map that can guide environmentalists toward that new and reenergized place in society.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of point cloud data in runoff evaluation is a non-resolved question. The increasingly use of unmanned aerial photogrammetric systems shows great opportunities, although they provide less accuracy data than traditional survey systems. This manuscript presents a new method to check the usage limits of point clouds obtained from unmanned aerial photogrammetry in runoff evaluation. The methodology uses D8 algorithm for the runoff estimation. The quality of photogrammetric data is evaluated by comparison with a light detection and ranging scanning dataset that acts as ground truth. The methodology includes point cloud rasterization, with pixel cells ranging from 0.25 m to 5 m. Five test zones are selected from the road pavement and ﬁve from the road slopes. Results show that the runoff evaluation from the unmanned aerial photogrammetric data diverges from the mobile light detection and ranging data as cell size decreases and resolution increases. Studies that require cell sizes below 1 m are very inﬂuenced by the lower accuracy of the photogrammetric point clouds. However, the unmanned aerial surveys in larger areas with cell sizes above 2 m are perfectly affordable for this type of technology, without implication in the quality of runoff results.},

On the other hand, they represent a problem in processes such as object detection/recognition, image matching, etc., because they may be confused with dark objects and change the image radiometric properties. We address this problem on aerial and outdoor color images in this work. We use a filter to find low intensities as a first step. For outdoor color images, we analyze spectrum ratio properties to refine the detection, and the results are assessed with a dataset containing ground truth. For the aerial case we validate the detections depending of the hue component of pixels. This stage takes into account that, in deep shadows, most pixels have blue or violet wavelengths because of an atmospheric scattering effect.},

However, at such high resolution, shadows will appear in the optical imagery effectively reducing the reflectance and emission signal received by imaging sensors. To date, research that evaluates procedures to identify the occurrence of shadows in imagery produced by UAVs is limited. In this study, the performance of four different shadow detection methods used in satellite imagery was evaluated for high-resolution UAV imagery collected over a California vineyard during the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) field campaigns. The performance of the shadow detection methods was compared and impacts of shadowed areas on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and estimated evapotranspiration (ET) using the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model are presented. The results indicated that two of the shadow detection methods, the supervised classification and index-based methods, had better performance than two other methods. Furthermore, assessment of shadowed pixels in the vine canopy led to significant differences in the calculated NDVI and ET in areas affected by shadows in the high-resolution imagery. Shadows are shown to have the greatest impact on modeled soil heat flux, while net radiation and sensible heat flux are less affected. Shadows also have an impact on the modeled Bowen ratio (ratio of sensible to latent heat) which can be used as an indicator of vine stress level.},

The results showed that an accuracy of sub-meter can be obtained using the employed method. In Geographical Information System (GIS), it is quite common that topographic map and orthophoto are used as a base map. Hence, the findings from this study could also be used as an input for GIS.

In this study, a global analysis of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B metadata obtained from the committee on Earth Observation Satellite (CEOS) Visualization Environment (COVE) tool for 2016 is presented. A global equal area projection grid defined every 0.05° is used considering each sensor and combined together. Histograms, maps and global summary statistics of the temporal revisit intervals (minimum, mean, and maximum) and the number of observations are reported. The temporal observation frequency improvements afforded by sensor combination are shown to be significant. In particular, considering Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-2B together will provide a global median average revisit interval of 2.9 days, and, over a year, a global median minimum revisit interval of 14 min (±1 min) and maximum revisit interval of 7.0 days.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13021-017-0078-9},
	abstract = {Forest degradation is a global phenomenon and while being an important indicator and precursor to further forest loss, carbon emissions due to degradation should also be accounted for in national reporting within the frame of UN REDD+. At regional to country scales, methods have been progressively developed to detect and map forest degradation, with these based on multi-resolution optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and/or LiDAR data. However, there is no one single method that can be applied to monitor forest degradation, largely due to the specific nature of the degradation type or process and the timeframe over which it is observed. The review assesses two main approaches to monitoring forest degradation: first, where detection is indicated by a change in canopy cover or proxies, and second, the quantification of loss (or gain) in above ground biomass (AGB). The discussion only considers degradation that has a visible impact on the forest canopy and is thus detectable by remote sensing. The first approach encompasses methods that characterise the type of degradation and track disturbance, detect gaps in, and fragmentation of, the forest canopy, and proxies that provide evidence of forestry activity. Progress in these topics has seen the extension of methods to higher resolution (both spatial and temporal) data to better capture the disturbance signal, distinguish degraded and intact forest, and monitor regrowth. Improvements in the reliability of mapping methods are anticipated by SAR-optical data fusion and use of very high resolution data. The second approach exploits EO sensors with known sensitivity to forest structure and biomass and discusses monitoring efforts using repeat LiDAR and SAR data. There has been progress in the capacity to discriminate forest age and growth stage using data fusion methods and LiDAR height metrics. Interferometric SAR and LiDAR have found new application in linking forest structure change to degradation in tropical forests. Estimates of AGB change have been demonstrated at national level using SAR and LiDAR-assisted approaches. Future improvements are anticipated with the availability of next generation LiDAR sensors. Improved access to relevant satellite data and best available methods are key to operational forest degradation monitoring. Countries will need to prioritise their monitoring efforts depending on the significance of the degradation, balanced against available resources. A better understanding of the drivers and impacts of degradation will help guide monitoring and restoration efforts. Ultimately we want to restore ecosystem service and function in degraded forests before the change is irreversible.},

	doi = {10.1109/CSPA.2012.6194754},
	abstract = {Determining tree species has involved a lot of studies in the past decades. This is because of the availability of certain tree species to produce a high market value type of wood or that it can be use for meditational purposes. In the old days, conventional method of survey needs to be conducted to identify tree species. This type of method is rather hard to inaccessible area and time consuming. With the advancement of the satellite imaging technology, inaccessible area can be visualize from an satellite image. Worldview-2 image data is one of the proofs of the remote sensing evolving technology that can be used in a lot and varieties of studies. The available of the near infrared band makes it very useful in vegetation analysis. Based on this study that has been conducted to eight sample leaves taken from the Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve, Kuala Lumpur, spectral signature extraction was successfully conducted on the near infrared bandwidth due to its sensitivity towards vegetation. The different of about 5\% between the signature extracted from the Spectra Vista GER 1500 and Worldview-2 data indicates that this image can be use successfully for vegetation analysis. However, it is very questionable whether high resolution can successfully delineate tree crown of a tree in a natural forest due to the complexity of the characteristics of the crown which is overlapping each other. This complexity is also a challenge for this study as to relate the spectral signature extracted with the accuracy of the segmentation and classification result. Furthermore it also will give some ideas to researchers as to figure what type of improvements can be made towards this study especially for natural forest.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest conservation and management can significantly benefit from information about the spatial distribution of tree species. Very-high resolution (VHR) spaceborne platforms have been hailed as a promising technology for mapping tree species over broad spatial extents. WorldView-3, the most advanced VHR sensor, provides spectral data in 16 bands covering the visible to near-infrared (VNIR, 400–1040 nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1210–2365 nm) wavelength ranges. It also collects images at unprecedented levels of details using a panchromatic band with 0.3-m of spatial resolution. However, the potential of WorldView-3 at its full spectral and spatial resolution for tropical tree species classification remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of WorldView-3 images acquired in the dry and wet seasons for tree species discrimination in tropical semi-deciduous forests. Classification experiments were performed using VNIR individually and combined with SWIR channels. To take advantage of the sub-metric resolution of the panchromatic band for classification, we applied an individual tree crown (ITC)-based approach that employed pan-sharpened VNIR bands and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture features. We determined whether the combination of images from the two annual seasons improves the classification accuracy. Finally, we investigated which plant traits influenced species detection. The new SWIR sensing capabilities of WorldView-3 increased the average producer’s accuracy up to 7.8\%, by enabling the detection of non-photosynthetic vegetation within ITCs. The combination of VNIR bands from the two annual seasons did not improve the classification results when compared to the results obtained using images from each season individually. The use of VNIR bands at their original 1.2-m spatial resolution yielded average producer’s accuracies of 43.1 ± 3.1\% and 38.8 ± 3\% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The ITC-based approach improved the accuracy to 70 ± 8\% in the wet and 68.4 ± 7.4\% in the dry season. Texture analysis of the panchromatic band enabled the detection of species-specific differences in crown structure, which improved species detection. The use of texture analysis, pan-sharpening, and ITC delineation is a potential approach to perform tree species classification in tropical forests with WorldView-3 satellite images.},

We tested an application of the EO-1 Hyperion satellite sensor to spectrally detect the location of five important tree taxa in the lowland humid tropical forests of southeastern Peru. Location: Peru, Departamento de Madre de Díos. Methods: We used linear discriminant analysis with a stepwise selection procedure to analyze two Hyperion datasets (July and December 2006) to choose the most informative narrow bands for classifying trees. Results: Optimal channels selected were different between the two seasons. Classification was 100\% successful for the five taxa when using 25 narrow bands and pixels that represented {\textbackslash}textgreater40\% of tree crowns. We applied the discriminant functions developed separately for the two seasons to the entire study area, and found significantly nonrandom overlap in the anticipated distributions of the five taxa between seasons. Conclusions: Despite known issues, such as signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, Hyperion imaging spectroscopy has potential for developing regional mapping of large-crowned tropical trees.},

	abstract = {Characterization of tropical forest trees has been limited to field-based techniques focused on measurement of diameter of the cylindrical part of the bole, with large uncertainty in measuring large trees with irregular shapes, and other size attributes such as total tree height and the crown size. Here, we introduce a methodology to decompose lidar point cloud data into 3D clusters corresponding to individual tree crowns (ITC) that enables the estimation of many biophysical variables of tropical forests such as tree height, crown area, crown volume, and tree number density. The ITC-based approach was tested using airborne high-resolution lidar data collected over the 50-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) plot in the Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The lack of tree height and crown size measurements in the field prohibits the direct validation of the ITC metrics. We assess the reliability of our method by comparing the aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated using ground and lidar individual tree measurements at multiple spatial scales, namely 1ha, 2.25ha, 4ha, and 6.25ha. We examined four different lidar-derived AGB models, with three based on individual tree height, crown volume, and crown area, and one with mean top canopy height (TCH) calculated at the plot level using the lidar canopy height model. Results show that the predictive power of all models based on ITC size and TCH increases with decreasing spatial resolution from 16.9\% at 1ha for the worst model to 5.0\% at 6.25ha for the best model. The TCH-based model performed slightly better than ITC-based models except at higher spatial scales ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde4ha) and when errors due to edge effects associated with tree crowns were reduced. Unlike the TCH models that change regionally depending on forest type and structure allometry, the ITC-based models are derived as a function of individual tree allometry and can be extended globally to all tropical forests. The method for lidar detection of individual crown size overcome some limitations of ground-based inventories such as 1) it is able to access crowns of large trees and 2) it enables the assessment of directional changes in tree density, canopy architecture and forest dynamics over large and inaccessible areas to support robust tropical ecological studies.},

	abstract = {Emergent trees, which are taller than surrounding trees with exposed crowns, provide crucial services to several rainforest species especially to endangered primates such as gibbons and siamangs (Hylobatidae). Hylobatids show a preference for emergent trees as sleeping sites and for vocal displays, however, they are under threat from both habitat modifications and the impacts of climate change. Traditional plot-based ground surveys have limitations in detecting and mapping emergent trees across a landscape, especially in dense tropical forests. In this study, a method is developed to detect emergent trees in a tropical rainforest in Sumatra, Indonesia, using a photogrammetric point cloud derived from RGB images collected using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). If a treetop, identified as a local maximum in a Digital Surface Model generated from the point cloud, was higher than the surrounding treetops (Trees\_EM), and its crown was exposed above its neighbours (Trees\_SL; assessed using slope and circularity measures), it was identified as an emergent tree, which might therefore be selected preferentially as a sleeping tree by hylobatids. A total of 54 out of 63 trees were classified as emergent by the developed algorithm and in the field. The algorithm is based on relative height rather than canopy height (due to a lack of terrain data in photogrammetric point clouds in a rainforest environment), which makes it equally applicable to photogrammetric and airborne laser scanning point cloud data.},

	abstract = {Recognition of the spatial variation in tree species composition is a necessary precondition for wise management and conservation of forests. In the Peruvian Amazonia, this goal is not yet achieved mostly because adequate species inventory data has been lacking. The recently started Peruvian national forest inventory (INFFS) is expected to change the situation. Here, we analyzed genus-level variation, summarized through non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), in a set of 157 INFFS inventory plots in lowland to low mountain rain forests (\&lt;2000 m above sea level) using Landsat satellite imagery and climatic, edaphic, and elevation data as predictor variables. Genus-level floristic patterns have earlier been found to be indicative of species-level patterns. In correlation tests, the floristic variation of tree genera was most strongly related to Landsat variables and secondly to climatic variables. We used random forest regression, under varying criteria of feature selection and cross-validation, to predict the floristic composition on the basis of Landsat and environmental data. The best model explained \&gt;60\% of the variation along NMDS axes 1 and 2 and 40\% of the variation along NMDS axis 3. We used this model to predict the three NMDS dimensions at a 450-m resolution over all of the Peruvian Amazonia and classified the pixels into 10 floristic classes using k-means classification. An indicator analysis identified statistically significant indicator genera for 8 out of the 10 classes. The results are congruent with earlier studies, suggesting that the approach is robust and can be applied to other tropical regions, which is useful for reducing research gaps and for identifying suitable areas for conservation.},

In Seitseminen and Liesjärvi, the images were compared to published vegetation maps, whereas Landsat study of the Baltic Sea Archipelago Park included comparisons with aerial photographs in addition to field observations. The results reveal that satellite imagery contains accurate information on environmental features, which are often difficult or impossible to examine by other means. However, satellite data fails to distinguish many of the vegetation types recognized by the Finnish phytosociological school, though the major physiognomic categories are for the most part discernible. The increasing number of vegetation studies based on remote sensing requires a re-evaluation of the classification criteria applied in the botanical tradition. Manual interpretation of digitally enhanced images is superior to supervised classification procedures in many botanical works, because the former is free from operator-defined classes which may not necessarily be representative. Many satellite-based mappings that are available at present are of limited value in biological studies because their accuracy is questionable. There is an urgent need for developing unified accuracy validation procedures to meet the needs of image users.},

The aim of this study is to establish an accurate classification procedure for tropical tree species, specifically testing the feasibility of WorldView-3 (WV-3) multispectral imagery for this task. The specific study site is a defined arboretum within a well-known tropical forest research location in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station). An object-based classification is the basis for the analysis to classify six selected tree species. A combination of pre-processed WV-3 bands were inputs to the classification, and an edge segmentation process defined multi-pixel-scale tree canopies. WorldView-3 bands in the Green, Red, Red Edge, and Near-Infrared 2, particularly when incorporated in two specialized vegetation indices, provide high discrimination among the selected species. Classification results yield an accuracy of 85.37\%, with minimal errors of commission (7.89\%) and omission (14.63\%). Shadowing in the satellite imagery had a significant effect on segmentation accuracy (identifying single-species canopy tops) and on classification. The methodology presented provides a path to better characterization of tropical forest species distribution and overall composition for improving biomass studies in a tropical environment.},

On the other hand, several studies have shown that elevation and the medium-resolution remote sensing data available via Landsat imagery can be successfully used to detect differences in plant species composition in Amazonia. Therefore, it seems likely that the same data can also be used to predict geographical distributions of individual taxa. Here we use remotely sensed data and a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to generate landscape-scale distribution models at 30-m-resolution for five economically important timber tree genera (Apuleia, Amburana, Crepidospermum, Dipteryx, and Manilkara). Individual Landsat Thematic Mapper bands and normalized difference vegetation index yielded acceptable model performance, and the use of averaging filters (3 × 3 and 5 × 5 pixel low-pass filters) improved model performance further. Including elevation as a predictor also improved model performance for all the genera. Our results suggest that it is possible to use Landsat bands and elevation as predictors for modeling the potential distribution of tree species in lowland Amazonia at a fine enough resolution to facilitate the practical management of forest resources.},

Each shadow region is matched to its adjacent non-shadowed region on RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space and HIS (Hue, Intensity, Saturation) color space respectively to finish shadow removal.

This paper presents an automatic property-based approach for the detection and compensation of shadow regions with shape information preserved in complex urban color aerial images for solving problems caused by cast shadows in digital image mapping. The technique is applied in several invariant color spaces that decouple luminance and chromaticity, including HSI, HSV, HCV, YIQ, and YC/sub b/C/sub r/ models. Experimental results from de-shadowing color aerial images of a complex building and a highway segment in these color models are evaluated in terms of visual comparisons and shadow detection accuracy assessments. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in revealing details under shadows and the suitability of these color models in de-shadowing urban color aerial images.},

As a step toward automatic map generation, we introduce a novel system to detect houses and street networks in IKONOS multispectral images. Our system consists of four main blocks: multispectral analysis to detect cultural activity, segmentation of possible human activity regions, decomposition of segmented images, and graph theoretical algorithms to extract the street network and to detect houses over the decompositions. We tested our system on a large and diverse data set. Our results indicate the usefulness of our system in detecting houses and street networks, hence generating automated maps.},

	abstract = {We aim at combining color and shape invariants for indexing and retrieving images. To this end, color models are proposed independent of the object geometry, object pose, and illumination. From these color models, color invariant edges are derived from which shape invariant features are computed. Computational methods are described to combine the color and shape invariants into a unified high-dimensional invariant feature set for discriminatory object retrieval. Experiments have been conducted on a database consisting of 500 images taken from multicolored man-made objects in real world scenes. From the theoretical and experimental results it is concluded that object retrieval based on composite color and shape invariant features provides excellent retrieval accuracy. Object retrieval based on color invariants provides very high retrieval accuracy whereas object retrieval based entirely on shape invariants yields poor discriminative power. Furthermore, the image retrieval scheme is highly robust to partial occlusion, object clutter and a change in the object's pose. Finally, the image retrieval scheme is integrated into the PicToSeek system on-line at http://www.wins.uva.nl/research/isis/PicToSeek/ for searching images on the World Wide Web},

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain, and a systematic filter selection scheme is proposed, which is based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of "energy" in a window around each pixel. A square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial information in the clustering process is proposed. A relative index is used to estimate the "'true" number of texture categories.},

When segmenting forest fire images, some edges can’t be segmented accurately. This method which will be introduced then can solve the foregoing problems. The specific practices include the following two steps. Firstly, threshold of Hurst parameter should be selected properly so as to get binary image after estimating the value of Hurst parameter. Secondly, the regions which are useful are extracted by using region growing method. Image segmentation based on fractal theory has good noise immunity, and detects various details of image. It is more significant for some images whose boundaries are irregular and complex. Traditional method is helpless for analyzing these images, while image segmentation method based on fractal can describe these images accurately. Therefore, this method based on FBM and Region Growing offers reliable data to the further image analysis and target recognition. It may achieve magnificent result.},

Bovik et al. proposed a multi-channel texture analysis technique that relies on 2-D Gabor filters to isolate regions of perceptually homogeneous texture in an image. Textures are modeled as a pattern dominated by a narrow band of spatial frequencies and orientations. Properly tuned Gabor filters react strongly to specific textures and weakly to all others. The amplitude of the channel outputs is compared to segment the textures. The phase of the channel outputs is used to locate discontinuities in the texture phase. In this paper the theory proposed by Bovik et Al. is revisited and the results of experimentation with the technique are presented. Texture segmentation using the magnitude of the channel response is shown to be robust with a variety of synthetic and real textures. Experimentation with texture segmentation using the phase of channel response is inconclusive.},

	abstract = {Accurately mapping the spatial distribution of tree species in tropical environments provides valuable insights for ecologists and forest managers. This process may play an important role in reducing fieldwork costs, monitoring changes in canopy biodiversity, and locating parent trees to collect seeds for forest restoration efforts. However, mapping tree species in tropical forests with remote sensing data is a challenge because of high floristic and spectral diversity. In this research, we discriminated and mapped tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests (Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome) by using airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral data in the 450 to 2400nm wavelength range. After quantifying the spectral variability within and among individual tree crowns of eight species, three supervised machine learning classifiers were applied to discriminate the species at the pixel level. Linear Discriminant Analysis outperformed Support Vector Machines with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVMs) kernels and Random Forests in almost all the tested cases. An average classification accuracy of 70\% was obtained when using the visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 450–919nm) bands. The inclusion of shortwave infrared bands (SWIR, 1045–2400nm) increased the accuracy to 84\%. Narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were also tested and increased the classification accuracy by up to 5\% when combined with VNIR features. Furthermore, the spectral bands of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite sensor were simulated for classification purposes. WV-3 VNIR bands provided an accuracy of 57.4\%, which increased to 74.8\% when using WV-3 SWIR bands. We also tested the production of species maps by using an object-oriented approach that integrated a novel segmentation algorithm that was tailored to delineate tree crowns and label high class membership pixels inside each object. In this scenario, RBF-SVMs produced the best species maps, correctly identifying 84.9\% of crowns with hyperspectral data and 78.5\% with simulated WV-3 data. The use of a reduced set of hyperspectral bands, which were selected with stepwise regression, did not significantly affect the classification accuracies but allowed us to depict the most important wavelengths to discriminate the species. These wavelengths were located around the green reflectance peak (550nm), at the red absorption feature (650nm) and in the SWIR range at 1200, 1700, 2100 and 2300nm. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach for mapping pioneering and climax tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, highlighting its potential use in forest recovery and inventory initiatives.},

	abstract = {Mapping tropical tree species at landscape scales to provide information for ecologists and forest managers is a new challenge for the remote sensing community. For this purpose, detection and delineation of individual tree crowns (ITCs) is a prerequisite. Here, we present a new method of automatic tree crown delineation based only on very high resolution images from WorldView-2 satellite and apply it to a region of the Atlantic rain forest with highly heterogeneous tropical canopy cover – the Santa Genebra forest reserve in Brazil. The method works in successive steps that involve pre-processing, selection of forested pixels, enhancement of borders, detection of pixels in the crown borders, correction of shade in large trees and, finally, segmentation of the tree crowns. Principally, the method uses four techniques: rolling ball algorithm and mathematical morphological operations to enhance the crown borders and ease the extraction of tree crowns; bimodal distribution parameters estimations to identify the shaded pixels in the gaps, borders, and crowns; and focal statistics for the analysis of neighbouring pixels. Crown detection is validated by comparing the delineated ITCs with a sample of ITCs delineated manually by visual interpretation. In addition, to test if the spectra of individual species are conserved in the automatic delineated crowns, we compare the accuracy of species prediction with automatic and manual delineated crowns with known species. We find that our method permits detection of up to 80\% of ITCs. The seven species with over 10 crowns identified in the field were mapped with reasonable accuracy (30.5–96\%) given that only WorldView-2 bands and texture features were used. Similar classification accuracies were obtained using both automatic and manual delineation, thereby confirming that species’ spectral responses are preserved in the automatic method and thus permitting the recognition of species at the landscape scale. Our method might support tropical forest applications, such as mapping species and canopy characteristics at the landscape scale.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.4193},
	abstract = {Forest canopies and tree crown structures are of high ecological importance. Measuring canopies and crowns by direct inventory methods is time‐consuming and of limited accuracy. High‐resolution inventory tools, in particular terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), is able to overcome these limitations and obtain three‐dimensional (3D) structural information about the canopy with a very high level of detail. The main objective of this study was to introduce a novel method to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics in canopy occupancy at the individual tree and local neighborhood level using high‐resolution 3D TLS data. For the analyses, a voxel grid approach was applied. The tree crowns were modeled through the combination of two approaches: the encasement of all crown points with a 3D α‐shape, which was then converted into a voxel grid, and the direct voxelization of the crown points. We show that canopy occupancy at individual tree level can be quantified as the crown volume occupied only by the respective tree or shared with neighboring trees. At the local neighborhood level, our method enables the precise determination of the extent of canopy space filling, the identification of tree–tree interactions, and the analysis of complementary space use. Using multitemporal TLS data recordings, this method allows the precise detection and quantification of changes in canopy occupancy through time. The method is applicable to a wide range of investigations in forest ecology research, including the study of tree diversity effects on forest productivity or growing space analyses for optimal tree growth. Due to the high accuracy of this novel method, it facilitates the precise analyses even of highly plastic individual tree crowns and, thus, the realistic representation of forest canopies. Moreover, our voxel grid framework is flexible enough to allow for the inclusion of further biotic and abiotic variables relevant to complex analyses of forest canopy dynamics.},

	abstract = {Energy production and consumption is a key element in future development which is inﬂuenced both by the technical possibilities available and by decision makers. Sustainability issues are closely linked in with energy policy, given the desire to increase the proportion of renewable energy. According to the Horizon 2020 climate and energy package, European Union (EU) member countries have to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit by 20\%, to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 20\% and to improve energy efﬁciency by 20\% by 2020. In this study we aim to assess the opportunities available to exploit solar radiation on roofs with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and photogrammetry techniques. The surveyed area was in Debrecen, the second largest city in Hungary. An aerial LiDAR survey was conducted with a density of 12 points/m2, over a 7 Â 1.8 km wide band. We extracted the building and roof models of the buildings from the point cloud. Furthermore, we applied a low-cost drone (DJI Phantom with a GoPro camera) in a smaller area of the LiDAR survey and also created a 3D model: buildings and roof planes were identiﬁed with multiresolution segmentation of the digital surface models (DSM) and orthophoto coverages. Building heights and building geometry were also extracted and validated in ﬁeld surveys. 50 buildings were chosen for the geodetic survey and the results of the accuracy assessment were extrapolated to other buildings; in addition to this, 100 building heights were measured. We focused primarily on the roofs, as these surfaces offer possible locations for thermal and photovoltaic equipment. We determined the slope and aspect of roof planes and calculated the incoming solar energy according to roof planes before comparing the results of the point cloud processing of LiDAR data and the segmentation of DSMs. Extracted roof geometries showed varying degrees of accuracy: the research proved that LiDAR-based roof-modelling is the best choice in residential areas, but the results of the drone survey did not differ signiﬁcantly. Generally, both approaches can be applied, because the solar radiation values calculated were similar. The aerial techniques combined with the multiresolution processing demonstrated can provide a valuable tool to estimate potential solar energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {It has been recently observed that aircrafts tend to be replaced by light, simple structure unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or mini unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAV) with the purpose of updating the field of aerial photogrammetry. The built-in digital photo camera takes images of the Earth’s surface. To satisfy the photogrammetric requirements of the photographic images, it is necessary to carry out the terrestrial project planning of the flight path before the flight, to select the appropriate flying height, the time for acquiring images, the speed of the UAV, and other parameters. The paper presents the results of project calculations concerning the UAV flights and the analysis of the terrestrial images acquired during the field-testing flights. The experience carried out so far in the Lithuanian landscape is shown. The taken images have been processed by PhotoMod photogrammetric system. The paper presents the results of calculation of the project values of the UAV flights taking the images by digital camera Canon S100 and the analysis of the possibilities of the UAV orthophoto images’ mode.},

	abstract = {Vertical vegetation structure in rangeland ecosystems can be a valuable indicator for assessing rangeland health and monitoring riparian areas, post-ﬁre recovery, available forage for livestock, and wildlife habitat. Federal land management agencies are directed to monitor and manage rangelands at landscapes scales, but traditional ﬁeld methods for measuring vegetation heights are often too costly and time consuming to apply at these broad scales. Most emerging remote sensing techniques capable of measuring surface and vegetation height (e.g., LiDAR or synthetic aperture radar) are often too expensive, and require specialized sensors. An alternative remote sensing approach that is potentially more practical for managers is to measure vegetation heights from digital stereo aerial photographs. As aerial photography is already commonly used for rangeland monitoring, acquiring it in stereo enables threedimensional modeling and estimation of vegetation height. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of estimating shrub heights from high-resolution (HR, 3-cm ground sampling distance) digital stereo-pair aerial images. Overlapping HR imagery was taken in March 2009 near Lake Mead, Nevada and 5-cm resolution digital surface models (DSMs) were created by photogrammetric methods (aerial triangulation, digital image matching) for twenty-six test plots. We compared the heights of individual shrubs and plot averages derived from the DSMs to ﬁeld measurements. We found strong positive correlations between ﬁeld and image measurements for several metrics. Individual shrub heights tended to be underestimated in the imagery, however, accuracy was higher for dense, compact shrubs compared with shrubs with thin branches. Plot averages of shrub height from DSMs were also strongly correlated to ﬁeld measurements but consistently underestimated. Grasses and forbs were generally too small to be detected with the resolution of the DSMs. Estimates of vertical structure will be more accurate in plots having low herbaceous cover and high amounts of dense shrubs. Through the use of statistically derived correction factors or choosing ﬁeld methods that better correlate with the imagery, vegetation heights from HR DSMs could be a valuable technique for broad-scale rangeland monitoring needs.},

The texture and color of the tree can be so homogenous that it is difficult to accurately extract the feature points. This problem makes it difficult to generate a DSM using aerial photogrammetry. This study attempted to determine a method for improving the accuracy of 3D information obtained from under a shade of tree. We used photos that were shot from under the tree, and combined scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and structure from motion (SfM) algorithms to conduct image-based modelling through the reconstruction of spatial geometry to produce a 3D point cloud. Data fusion was conducted to generate an entire DSM by integrating point cloud into a DSM map by using aerial photogrammetry. We assessed the accuracy of a DSM of the entire study area to extract feature points from study area as the control points in a data fusion of the point cloud and the DSM produced by aerial photogrammetry.},

	abstract = {Micro-unmanned aerial vehicles often collect a large amount of images when mapping an area at an ultrahigh resolution. A direct georeferencing technique potentially eliminates the need for ground control points. In this paper, we developed a camera–global positioning system (GPS) module to allow the synchronization of camera exposure with the airframe’s position as recorded by a GPS with 10–20-cm accuracy. Lever arm corrections were applied to the camera positions to account for the positional difference between the GPS antenna and the camera center. Image selection algorithms were implemented to eliminate blurry images and images with excessive overlap. This study compared three different software methods (Photoscan, Pix4D web service, and an in-house Bundler method). We evaluated each based on processing time, ease of use, and the spatial accuracy of the ﬁnal mosaic produced. Photoscan showed the best performance as it was the fastest and the easiest to use and had the best spatial accuracy (average error of 0.11 m with a standard deviation of 0.02 m). This accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the differential GPS unit (10–20 cm) used to record camera position. Pix4D achieved a mean spatial error of 0.24 m with a standard deviation of 0.03 m, while the Bundler method had the worst mean spatial accuracy of 0.76 m with a standard deviation of 0.15 m. The lower performance of the Bundler method was due to its poor performance in estimating camera focal length, which, in turn, introduced large errors in the Z-axis for the translation equations.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the use of light weight rotary-wing UAV for mapping simulation model. The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of the photogrammetric output. This study only concentrates on one type of rotor-wing UAV. It is because rotor-wing units are more stable and able to capture images easily. It allows remote control UAV to be practiced in any environment and urban mapping. In the simulation model, ground control points (GCP) and checked point (CP) were established using total station. The GCP is used in the photogrammetric processes to produce photogrammetric output while the CP is used for accuracy assessment. A Nikon Coolpix consumer digital camera was used for images acquisition of the simulation model where two methods were used. In the first method, the camera was mounted vertically in a rotary-wing UAV and captured the images at an altitude. In the second method, the camera is mounted vertically at a fixed height. The acquired images were processed using photogrammetric software to produce orthophoto and digital elevation model of the simulation model. From this study, it was found that root mean square errors for fixed platform are +0.002m, +0.001m, +0.214m for coordinate x, y and z respectively while the root mean square errors for mobile platform are +0.002m, +0.002m, +0.223m for coordinate x, y and z respectively. It can be concluded that the differences between the mobile and fixed platforms are not significant. In conclusion, UAV system can be used for large scale mapping for aerial terrain mapping.},

	abstract = {Forests play important role as environment for living things. There are many types of forest stand and the identification of forest type is available to conserve and to improve the forest. The field investigation on forest area is a hard work and needs many cost. The field investigation on wide area is almost impossible. The remote-sensing is useful for investigation of wide area of forest, especially on mountain area where field investigations are usually laborious. The spectral characteristics are different by the species. Many classifications of forest type based on spatial characteristics are operated. But, some kinds of forest types are difficult to be classified by using only spatial characteristics. Each type of forest stand has a spatial characteristic depending on the shape of trees. By using not only spatial characteristics but also tree shapes, number of classified types of forest can be increased. We developed the method for the delineation of tree crown with image processing using satellite images with high spatial resolution and aerial photographs. In this method, tree crowns that have similar color are delineated with circles. Densities, size and numbers of trees are different by species, and these information are available to classify the type of forest stand. In this study, forest stands were classified with not only spatial information but also the number and densities of trees. Multi-spectral images and pan image of IKONOS were used in this study. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) was calculated from red and near-infrared images. Densities and numbers of trees on a forest stand were calculated using pan images with high spatial resolution by using the method for crown delineation with circler expression. The types of forest stand were classified using thresholds of NDVI and numbers of trees. A forest classification method using spatial information, densities and numbers of trees increased the number of classified type of forests than using only spatial information.},

	abstract = {This paper shows some practical experiences of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-(UAV) based platform for remote sensing in supporting precision agriculture mapping. Some of the information for land preparation, cadaster boundary, vegetation monitoring, plant healthy, and stock valuation are required periodically. So, the UAV-Based remote sensing system should have characteristics such as cost-effective, fast in producing, easy in operation by local staff, and good geometry accuracy (sub-meter). The system consists of aerial platforms from R/C plane, point and shoots digital cameras, data processing with digital photogrammetric: structure from motion algorithms, and free open source-GIS for visualizing. This system has the ability to produce imagery with spatial resolution {\textless}10cm, measuring parcel area, assess the individual trees or plants stock, and topography. The basic products of the system are Orthophoto Image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The Average geometric accuracy can be obtained up to 3 pixels or equivalent to sub-meter accuracy, while the production time can be reached more than 500Ha a day. The Orthophoto image could provide visual interpretation such as the individual trees structure, plant density, and parcel boundary area, while DEM could asses tree's height information and terrain topography with accuracy 3-6 pixel or 0.5-2.5 m.},

	abstract = {A method for detecting Spruce tree tops in high resolution panchromatic images at acute angles has earlier been reported. The method uses an optical tree model and ﬂight data to generate a template tree image, i.e. an image of what the "average" tree would look like if placed at a certain point in the imaged scene. A window into the template image is matched to the actual forest image by at each pixel computing the correlation of the local intensity values. Local maxima in the resulting correlation image correspond to high similarity with the template image and thus correspond to positions where there might be a tree. It is clear that the shape and size of the match window and its placement within the template image has an impact on the performance of this tree top detection algorithm. For a speciﬁc parameterisation of the match window shape, size and placement and a speciﬁc set of images where the real tree positions are known one can ﬁnd an empirical optimum for the average performance of the algorithm over the images. Such an examination for images of an even-aged pure Spruce stand yielded surprising results: The optimal size was signiﬁcantly smaller than expected and the optimal shape close to a circle. By using the estimated optimal parameter values rather than those used in the work earlier reported, the tree top detection rate was increased from 85–92\% to 91–98\%.},
